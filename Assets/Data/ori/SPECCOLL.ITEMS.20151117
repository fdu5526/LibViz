.500.   |aOne of twenty-five signed copies.
.520.   |aAccording to the artist, this is a step by step guide to the use of
literary essences as natural health remedies for emotional and spiritual
well-being. Each vial contains lozenge-sized circles allegedly punched from
pages of twenty-six works of literature, in a solution that captures the
precise and particular odor of that work. Each essence - hence, each book -
cures, alleviates, or engages certain feelings, symptoms, or conditions. The
index cards indicate which. Directions call for the ingestion of four paper
circles to commence healing.

participation in The Fourth International Biennale for the Artists' Book hosted
by The Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Alexandria, Egypt in the spring of 2010. The
assigned theme of nomadism led me to do much research and reflecting on the
steady decline of the grasslands of Central Asia and Mongolia, and the
disappearance of nomadic pastoralism in those parts of the world. In 2010,
Mongolia experienced one of the harshest winters in a decade causing
catastrophic losses of herds that may force many nomadic families to abandon
their traditional way of life"--Colophon.

.520.   |aAfter being interned with his parents at the Minikoda Internment Camp
in Idaho, Frank Masao Shigemura was released to attend Carleton College in
Northfield, Minnesota, with the help of the newly formed National Student
Relocation Council, headed by John W. Nason. Although Shigemura described his
year at Carleton as the best of his life, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. He was
killed in battle in France on October 20, 1944. When Carleton published a
memorial "Gold Star" booklet which honored the Carleton men who had been killed
in the war, Mr. and Mrs. Shigemura responded with the first of many donations
to the college. From their correspondence, Carleton President Laurence M. Gould
developed a friendship with the Shigemuras, and as their contributions
continued, helped establish the Frank Shigemura Scholarship at Carleton. The
alumni felt Frank's loyalty should be made public and asked George Grimm, a
columnist, to write about it. Grimm wrote a series of articles on the
Shigemuras's generosity; the articles were collected and reprinted elsewhere.
.545.   |aThe National Student Relocation Council, a non-government agency, was
formally organized in 1942 to help interned students, mostly
Japanese-Americans, continue their education outside the evacuated zones.

.520.   |a"This collection of Persian love lyrics were shown to me by a
calligraphy student in New Zealand over 30 years ago. I immediately resonated
to this beautiful translation and have consequently created many works of art
on vellum using these poems. The book evolved as I researched Arabic
calligraphy as a basis for some of my designs and I juxtaposed the fine writing
with a hint of bold Arabic mark-making so each page became a work of art in its
own right. I specifically designed the book in this large concertina format so
it can be displayed on a book stand, so each double spread can be viewed and
enjoyed simultaneously. I have bound each book individually with some hand
finishing in both gold and silver foils, to give specific pages a rich
illumination where I feel it is appropriate to the verse ... I have hand bound
each edition of this concertina book using the highly decorated cover page of a
minaret to express my interpretation of Persian art"--Dave Wood at

Light, with noirish moments of Shadow, plus Centaur & Arrighi here. Printed on
dampened Rives de Lin, with Metallic Black & Silver covers and Habnemuble Bugra
Butten endpapers. The photographs were shot by myself with the generous
collaboration of the models, Will Shumway and Gene Tierney. Speaking of
shooting, Mark Schacht used a 9mm pistol to fill the covers full of daylight.
Copies One through Seven are housed in a louvered wooden box, created by John

.500.   |a"I have created this shadow book with paper-cut-out images of Korean
traditional doors. The process of cutting the pattern of the doors to create
shadows recalls my memories of my grandmother in her old house. When I was
inside, I could see the shadow of Grandmother cast on the paper doors from
outside. Grandmother's presence as a shadow on the door has remained a strong
image in my mind. Unlike many other doors, the traditional rice paper door does
not totally block the inside and out from eath other. It only creates the
concept of this side and the other while simultaneously connecting them to each
other. When this accordion book is unfolded, the pages are shaped as closed,
connecting the memories of my Grandmother, who is now in the other side, with
myself in this world."--Author's statement.

.300.   |a1 v. (unpaged). :|bcol. ill. ;|c31 x 36 cm.
.500.   |aLabor/Movement (seven workers) depicts movement visually in book
form, while calling attention to the complexity of everyday human activity. The
book tracks the motions of seven workers over a brief period of time with lines
that change in length, width and color. As the segments of motion grow, page by
page, lines intersect and interact, joining to form an intricate pattern on top
of a static industrial floor. Shades of silver ink overlap to create a rich,
opulent field that belies the seemingly humble activity. Each folio is sewn
onto the mountain fold of a concertina. When the concertina is fully extended
by the reader, a portion of each page can be seen simultaneously with each
other page, exposing the frame by frame growth of the movement pattern. The
reader/viewer is implicated in the performance of the book and asked to be
aware of her movements as she interacts with the
piece.--www.shelterbookworks.com
.500.   |aThese abstract reductions of the movements of workers are inspired by
the work of Frank and Lillian Gilbreth who developed time and motion studies in
the early 20th century to improve worker efficiency and productivity. Their
work broke down any job into a series of discreet movements that could be
repeated by anyone, obviating the need for specialized and skilled
laborers.--www.shelterbookworks.com
.500.   |aThe imagery is paired with 'Lecture on Moving, ' a text by Yvonne
Rainer, reprinted with permission of the author, originally published in Aspen
magazine, 1971. Yvonne Rainer is an avant garde dancer and filmmaker whose
dance work often highlights everyday movements. In the text, YR leads a group
through an exercise designed to make the participants more aware of their
physical presence in the world. She lists the dictionary definitions of a
variety of action works, that, when placed in the context of the "performance"
become evocative of more than their simple
definitions.--www.shelterbookworks.com

token is of a bookseller's stall on Al-Mutanabbi Street in Baghdad prior to the
bombing in 2007, and is used by permission of the Al-Mutanabbi Street
Coalition.  Special thanks to Nicole Trigg, Sibila Savage, Leia Reedijk and
Elizabeth McDevitt. This edition was letterpress printed in an edition of 50
copies and is part of An Inventory of Al-Mutanabbi Street."--Colophon.
.500.   |a"A custom-made copper case/locket by Christina Kemp houses on one
side a miniature book which is letterpress printed on Kitakata; it opens on the
other side to reveal a triptych. The case/locket and a web strip (for wearing
the locket) are housed in cavities in a padded clamshell box [18 x 15 x 8 cm]
with title on the cover. The colophon slips into a groove in the box's base.

.520.   |a"Memento is about the fragility of the book and the power of reading.
It includes a miniature book that is housed in a metal locket that allows the
reader to wear the book close to the body. The simple act of carrying a book on
one's person has diverse implications depending on circumstance and place ...
While the commemorative aspect of this piece is clear, the content of Memento
addresses philosophical questions about the nature of reading and information
transfer in our own lives as well as within the context of western culture in
general."--Artist's statement from Vamp & Tramp Booksellers website (viewed

discoveries of meaning in the natural forces and phenomena of the cosmos. The
title refers to a time soon after the Big Bang, when a small preponderance of
matter over antimatter was produced.

intersect at Otis College of Art and Design. The flag book structure presented
the perfect form to incorporate four journeys to the college in both a literal
storytelling manner as well as a larger historical perspective that brought the
collaborators together.  The book contains the artists' journey in the codex of
the book, with a map of Los Angeles as the flag image, and the back of the
spine which contains the colophon, method, means, and biographical information
of the artists: Jennifer Graves, Janet Kupchick, Leslie Ross-Robertson, and
