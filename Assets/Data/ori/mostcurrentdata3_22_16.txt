.545. 0 |aCharles Bukowski was born on August 16, 1920 in Andernach, Germany,
the son of a US soldier and German woman.  His family immigrated to the United
States in 1922 and settled in Los Angeles, where Bukowski spent most of his
life.  His father was in and out of work during the Depression years and was a
reputed tyrant, verbally and physically abusing his son throughout his
childhood.  It was perhaps to numb himself from his father's abuse that
Bukowski began drinking at the age of 13, initiating his life-long affair with
alcohol.  After graduating from Los Angeles High School in 1939 Bukowski
studied for a time at Los Angeles City College, taking courses in journalism
and literature.  He left school and home in 1941 after his father, who had
finally read some of Bukowski's stories, threw his son's possessions into the
street.  Bukowski continued to write stories and traveled across America,
supporting himself with a string of odd jobs: gas station attendant, elevator
operator, truck driver, and overseer in a dog biscuit factory, to name a few.
In 1944 his story Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip was published in the
magazine Story.  He returned to Los Angeles and met Janet Cooney Baker, with
whom he lived for the next ten years.  In 1955, Bukowski was hospitalized with
an alcohol-induced bleeding ulcer and came close to death.  After a brief
marriage to Barbara Frye, the rich publisher of a small poetry magazine,
Bukowski took a job as a post office clerk in 1958, a job he held for the next
twelve years.  In 1955, Bukowski also began writing poetry, publishing volumes
almost annually.  His first collection, Flower, Fist, and Bestial Wail,
appeared in 1959.  It was 30 pages long and the print run was only 200 copies.
Bukowski's first volume of prose, All Assholes in the World and Mine, was
published seven years later.  By 1963, the year Bukowski published It Catches
My Heart in Its Hands--a collection of poetry about alcoholics, prostitutes,
losing gamblers, and other down-and-outs--he had developed a loyal following,
and was famous for his use of violent images and graphic language in his work.
His column Notes of a Dirty Old Man appeared regularly in Open City and Los
Angles Free Press, and its run was later collected in book by the same title
(1969).  In 1970, Bukowski quit his job with the Postal Service when John
Martin of the Black Sparrow Press offered him a $100 monthly stipend to
continue his writing.  Although prolific, Bukowski remained a literary outsider
who published his works with small presses, primarily on the West Coast.  His
short stories are unsparingly realistic and usually comic.  They often observe
the thoughts and actions of Bukowski's alter ego Henry Chinaski, a
hard-drinking unskilled worker, a lover of classical music, and a racetrack
gambler.  This character was introduced in Bukowski's 1965 autobiographical
Confessions of a Man Insane Enough to Live with the Beasts.  In 1973, Bukowski
gained a wider audience when an award-winning television documentary by
director Taylor Hackford was aired, and he also began an incidental career in
the film industry.  The 1983 film Tales of Ordinary Madness, directed by Marco
Ferreri, was based on stories of the author.  Its script drew material from
Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions and Tales of Ordinary Madness.  The
screenplay for the film Barfly (1987) was written by Bukowski himself and
directed by Barbet Schroeder, and the experience of the filming became the
subject of the 1989 novel Hollywood.  Crazy Love/Love is a Dog from Hell
(1989), directed by Dominique Deruddere, was based on The Copulating Mermaid of
Venice and other stories by Bukowski.  In 1985 Bukowski married Linda Lee
Beighle, a health food proprietor twenty-five years his junior.  He had one
daughter, Marina Louise, who was born in 1965 to Bukowski and Francis Dean
Smith.  In his later years, success caught up with the author at last and he
evolved from down-and-out to up-and-in: he lived in a house with a swimming
pool, drove a black BMW, wrote on a computer, and enjoyed his favorite
recordings of Sibelius, Mahler, and Rossini on a new stereo.  Charles Bukowski
died at age 73 on March 9, 1994, at a hospital in San Pedro, California, after
an almost year-long bout with leukemia.

Vienna in 1902, and Eisler grew up and studied there, most notably with Arnold
Schoenberg in the early 1920s. He moved to Berlin in 1925. Due to his strongly
Marxist political convictions Eisler left Nazi Germany in 1933, and travelled
extensively for four years. He began teaching at the New School for Social
Research in New York in 1938. Four years later he moved to Los Angeles, where
he taught composition at UCLA, worked closely with Bertolt Brecht, wrote scores
for motion pictures, and co-authored with Theodor Adorno, "Composing for the
Films."  He was expelled from the United States because of his Communist
sympathies in March 1948, and settled in East Berlin for the rest of his life,
where he was professor at the Berlin Hochschule fuer Musik and continued to
write for films, compose songs and concert works.

.500.   |aThe entire unbound work is contained in a cloth-lined brown buckram
wrapper held in a brown buckram slipcase with brown half-leather binding, and
the spine title stamped in gold.
.500.   |aIn December 1944 Brecht and his collaborator, Ruth Berlau, assembled
the photoepigrams into this small-format Kriegsfibel. The collection contains
seventy-one photoepigrams mounted on hand-cut sheets of black construction
paper, with page numbers written by Brecht on the verso of each sheet. Also
included is a title page and dedication sheet on onionskin paper. The pencil
lines for marking the paper and the ragged hand-cut edges of the photographs
are still visible. It is quite likely that Berlau herself reproduced the
photographs from images that Brecht found in various publications, including
Life magazine and Swedish and American newspapers.
.500.   |aIn 1944 Brecht presented this miniature copy of Kriegsfibel to Lion
Feuchtwanger, his longtime friend, mentor, and collaborator and a fellow German
exile living in Southern California. Brecht sent another copy to his friend
Karl Korsch in February 1945; whether additional copies were created or still
exist is unknown. In 1949, after Brecht returned to Germany, he and Berlau
assembled the Kriegsfibel for publication; it did not appear, however, until
the fall of 1955. The published work does not duplicate Brecht's smaller format
but instead re-creates the manuscript now located at the Brecht Archive in
Berlin. Both the 1954 and 1994 versions were enlarged to two and a half times
the size of the Feuchtwanger version.

literary essences as natural health remedies for emotional and spiritual
well-being. Each vial contains lozenge-sized circles allegedly punched from
pages of twenty-six works of literature, in a solution that captures the
precise and particular odor of that work. Each essence - hence, each book -
cures, alleviates, or engages certain feelings, symptoms, or conditions. The
index cards indicate which. Directions call for the ingestion of four paper
circles to commence healing.

.545. 0 |aThe Turner Brothers Circus (aka Turner Brothers Dog and Pony show)
was created by Percy Turner in 1958.  Percy Turner was, by trade, a sign
painter in the  area of San Diego, California.   He and his family had always
wanted to have their own circus, so in 1959 they formed their own.  They had a
lion, a tiger, two ocelots, an elephant, and several camels, clowns, acrobats,
a high-wire artist, a dog act and horses, but the Turner family were the only
Black members of the troupe.  The Turners left their successful sign-painting
business in Pacific  Beach to tour the California coast and were widely
successful with audiences. Unfortunately, they had no circus experience and the
show was forced to close after they discovered their advance agent was skimming
the profits.   Percy Turner went back to sign painting and later lettered some
trucks for Circus Vargas when they were in Southern California.  Percy Turner
kept hoping to find someone else who could provide the financial means to allow
him to take out another circus, but his failing health and increased costs
prevented him from ever touring again. The Turner Bros. Circus officially
closed for good on July 4, 1959.  Ralph Rodgers, whose "day job" was as a gas
service man for San Diego Gas & Electric, was an avid circus model builder and
lifelong circus devotee.   He spent his lifetime learning about the circus,
following all the circuses--figuratively and later literally-- and becoming
friends with many of the well-known circus performers and clowns of the day,
many of whom were also model-builders.   Ralph Rodgers' wife, Mary Ann, was
supportive of her husband's hobby and also worked with him and attended
conventions with him.  They had four sons:  Patrick, Kevin, Michael, and John,
all of whom had model circuses named after them.  The circuses were created in
the Rodgers' backyard in El Cajon and reflected Ralph's desire to preserve the
form and spirit of the circus during its heyday of the 1920s and 30s.  Images
of Rodgers' circus can be viewed online at:

.545. 1 |aMineral King is a glacial valley in the southern Sierra Nevada
mountains, only 7 1/2 square miles in size and one of the oldest communities in
the High Sierra.  At one time, the area had been occupied by two Native
American tribes including the Wikchumni Yokut and the Tubatulabel who created
summer settlements on the valley floor primarily  for hunting and trading with
the Paiutes, who lived east of the Sierra Nevada.  In the 1860s, the first
Americans of European descent discovered the valley while building a toll trail
from Visalia to Independence and began to mine for precious metals, leading to
the discovery of silver in the Mineral King Valley in 1872.  Following the
discovery, the first road to Mineral King was created in 1873 by the Mineral
King Wagon and Toll Road Company.  Over time, the minerals were found to be
unprofitable to extract from their ore, but the valley kept its hopeful name:
Mineral King.Mineral King had been part of Sequoia National Forest since 1926,
and in the late 1940s the United States Forest Service began to give
consideration to Mineral King as a potential site for recreational development.
Prodded by a rapidly increasing demand for ski facilities, the Forest Service
published a prospectus in 1965, inviting bids from private developers for the
construction and operation of a ski resort that would also serve as a summer
recreation area.  The proposal of Walt Disney Enterprises, Inc. was chosen from
those of six bidders, and Disney received a three-year permit to conduct
surveys and explorations in the valley in connection with its preparation of a
complete master plan for the resort.  The final Disney plan, approved by the
Forest Service in January 1969 (and supported by Governor Ronald Reagan, a
friend of Disney), outlined a $35 million complex of motels, restaurants,
swimming pools, parking lots, and other structures designed to accommodate
14,000 visitors daily. The complex was to be constructed on 80 acres of the
valley floor under a 30-year use permit from the Forest Service.  Other
facilities, including ski lifts, ski trails, a cog-assisted railway, and
utility installations, were to be constructed on the mountain slopes and in
other parts of the valley under a revocable special-use permit.  To provide
access to the resort, the state of California proposed to construct a highway
20 miles in length.  A section of that road would have traversed Sequoia
National Park, as would have a proposed high-voltage power line needed to
provide electricity for the resort.  In June 1969 the Sierra Club filed suit in
the Federal District Court of Northern California to attempt to stop the
project and the court issued a temporary injunction the following month which
blocked implementation of the Forest Service/ Disney development plan for the
basin for three full years before the U.S. Supreme Court finally addressed the
Sierra Club's lawsuit.  (Disney had anticipated opening the resort in 1970 or
1971.)  In an April 1972 decision, the Court rejected the suit, which
challenged the legality of the entire resort development scheme, on the grounds
that the Sierra Club had not established that it was suffering direct harm as a
result of the Forest Service's actions.In June the Sierra Club filed an amended
suit; soon public opposition to Mineral King development began to increase in
an era of unparalleled environmental awareness and activism.  After years of
legal battles between pro-development  and preservationist groups, the Mineral
King Valley was annexed into Sequoia National Park in 1978 by an act of
Congress.  That legislation effectively stopped the plan to ever develop the
area into a ski resort.

.545. 0 |aThe Turner Brothers Circus (aka Turner Brothers Dog and Pony show)
was created by Percy Turner in 1958.  Percy Turner was, by trade, a sign
painter in the  area of San Diego, California.   He and his family had always
wanted to have their own circus, so in 1959 they formed their own.  They had a
lion, a tiger, two ocelots, an elephant, and several camels, clowns, acrobats,
a high-wire artist, a dog act and horses, but the Turner family were the only
Black members of the troupe.  The Turners left their successful sign-painting
business in Pacific  Beach to tour the California coast and were widely
successful with audiences. Unfortunately, they had no circus experience and the
show was forced to close after they discovered their advance agent was skimming
the profits.   Percy Turner went back to sign painting and later lettered some
trucks for Circus Vargas when they were in Southern California.  Percy Turner
kept hoping to find someone else who could provide the financial means to allow
him to take out another circus, but his failing health and increased costs
prevented him from ever touring again. The Turner Bros. Circus officially
closed for good on July 4, 1959.  Ralph Rodgers, whose "day job" was as a gas
service man for San Diego Gas & Electric, was an avid circus model builder and
lifelong circus devotee.   He spent his lifetime learning about the circus,
following all the circuses--figuratively and later literally-- and becoming
friends with many of the well-known circus performers and clowns of the day,
many of whom were also model-builders.   Ralph Rodgers' wife, Mary Ann, was
supportive of her husband's hobby and also worked with him and attended
conventions with him.  They had four sons:  Patrick, Kevin, Michael, and John,
all of whom had model circuses named after them.  The circuses were created in
the Rodgers' backyard in El Cajon and reflected Ralph's desire to preserve the
form and spirit of the circus during its heyday of the 1920s and 30s.  Images
of Rodgers' circus can be viewed online at:

.545. 0 |aThe Turner Brothers Circus (aka Turner Brothers Dog and Pony show)
was created by Percy Turner in 1958.  Percy Turner was, by trade, a sign
painter in the  area of San Diego, California.   He and his family had always
wanted to have their own circus, so in 1959 they formed their own.  They had a
lion, a tiger, two ocelots, an elephant, and several camels, clowns, acrobats,
a high-wire artist, a dog act and horses, but the Turner family were the only
Black members of the troupe.  The Turners left their successful sign-painting
business in Pacific  Beach to tour the California coast and were widely
successful with audiences. Unfortunately, they had no circus experience and the
show was forced to close after they discovered their advance agent was skimming
the profits.   Percy Turner went back to sign painting and later lettered some
trucks for Circus Vargas when they were in Southern California.  Percy Turner
kept hoping to find someone else who could provide the financial means to allow
him to take out another circus, but his failing health and increased costs
prevented him from ever touring again. The Turner Bros. Circus officially
closed for good on July 4, 1959.  Ralph Rodgers, whose "day job" was as a gas
service man for San Diego Gas & Electric, was an avid circus model builder and
lifelong circus devotee.   He spent his lifetime learning about the circus,
following all the circuses--figuratively and later literally-- and becoming
friends with many of the well-known circus performers and clowns of the day,
many of whom were also model-builders.   Ralph Rodgers' wife, Mary Ann, was
supportive of her husband's hobby and also worked with him and attended
conventions with him.  They had four sons:  Patrick, Kevin, Michael, and John,
all of whom had model circuses named after them.  The circuses were created in
the Rodgers' backyard in El Cajon and reflected Ralph's desire to preserve the
form and spirit of the circus during its heyday of the 1920s and 30s.  Images

.545. 0 |aThe Turner Brothers Circus (aka Turner Brothers Dog and Pony show)
was created by Percy Turner in 1958.  Percy Turner was, by trade, a sign
painter in the  area of San Diego, California.   He and his family had always
wanted to have their own circus, so in 1959 they formed their own.  They had a
lion, a tiger, two ocelots, an elephant, and several camels, clowns, acrobats,
a high-wire artist, a dog act and horses, but the Turner family were the only
Black members of the troupe.  The Turners left their successful sign-painting
business in Pacific  Beach to tour the California coast and were widely
successful with audiences. Unfortunately, they had no circus experience and the
show was forced to close after they discovered their advance agent was skimming
the profits.   Percy Turner went back to sign painting and later lettered some
trucks for Circus Vargas when they were in Southern California.  Percy Turner
kept hoping to find someone else who could provide the financial means to allow
him to take out another circus, but his failing health and increased costs
prevented him from ever touring again. The Turner Bros. Circus officially
closed for good on July 4, 1959.  Ralph Rodgers, whose "day job" was as a gas
service man for San Diego Gas & Electric, was an avid circus model builder and
lifelong circus devotee.   He spent his lifetime learning about the circus,
following all the circuses--figuratively and later literally-- and becoming
friends with many of the well-known circus performers and clowns of the day,
many of whom were also model-builders.   Ralph Rodgers' wife, Mary Ann, was
supportive of her husband's hobby and also worked with him and attended
conventions with him.  They had four sons:  Patrick, Kevin, Michael, and John,
all of whom had model circuses named after them.  The circuses were created in
the Rodgers' backyard in El Cajon and reflected Ralph's desire to preserve the
form and spirit of the circus during its heyday of the 1920s and 30s.  Images
of Rodgers' circus can be viewed online at:

.545. 1 |aEdwin Markham dedicated the Poets Garden, located in Ruth Le Prade's
backyard at 1622 S. Spaulding Street, in April 1927 with the planting of a
sycamore tree called the Song Tree in honor of Ruth Le Prade and a wisteria
tree for Peace.  Between 1927 and Le Prade's death in 1969, other trees were
planted in honor of poets and literary figures, including a Gingko tree to
honor the Chinese poet Moon Kwan, an oak tree for Chaucer and trees honoring
William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Rudyard Kipling and Edwin Markham.  There
were also trees in the Poets Garden dedicated to Jesus, the Divine Mother
(Mary) and Brotherhood.  The slogan of the Garden was "Bread, Beauty and
Brotherhood".  Le Prade hosted events at Christmas and Markham's birthday every
year in the garden, and many of the people represented in this collection were
attendees of these events.  However, the Poets Garden was not just a physical
garden.  It also consisted of Ruth Le Prade's circle of acquaintances, friends
and correspondents, most of whom were writers and/or poets.  Le Prade kept much
of her correspondence with "members" of the Poets Garden (there was, however,
no official membership).  In some cases, most notably Gordon Norris and Robert
Whitaker, Le Prade received the papers and correspondence of her friends to add
to her collection.  Beginning in 1953, Le Prade began to donate most of her
collection (both books and paper records) to the University of Southern
California.  She also gave a collection documenting Florence Hamilton's
relationship with Edwin Markham to the Library of Congress in 1953.

.545. 1 |aEdwin Markham dedicated the Poets Garden, located in Ruth Le Prade's
backyard at 1622 S. Spaulding Street, in April 1927 with the planting of a
sycamore tree called the Song Tree in honor of Ruth Le Prade and a wisteria
tree for Peace.  Between 1927 and Le Prade's death in 1969, other trees were
planted in honor of poets and literary figures, including a Gingko tree to
honor the Chinese poet Moon Kwan, an oak tree for Chaucer and trees honoring
William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Rudyard Kipling and Edwin Markham.  There
were also trees in the Poets Garden dedicated to Jesus, the Divine Mother
(Mary) and Brotherhood.  The slogan of the Garden was "Bread, Beauty and
Brotherhood".  Le Prade hosted events at Christmas and Markham's birthday every
year in the garden, and many of the people represented in this collection were
attendees of these events.  However, the Poets Garden was not just a physical
garden.  It also consisted of Ruth Le Prade's circle of acquaintances, friends
and correspondents, most of whom were writers and/or poets.  Le Prade kept much
of her correspondence with "members" of the Poets Garden (there was, however,
no official membership).  In some cases, most notably Gordon Norris and Robert
Whitaker, Le Prade received the papers and correspondence of her friends to add
to her collection.  Beginning in 1953, Le Prade began to donate most of her
collection (both books and paper records) to the University of Southern
California.  She also gave a collection documenting Florence Hamilton's
relationship with Edwin Markham to the Library of Congress in 1953.

.545. 0 |aThe Turner Brothers Circus (aka Turner Brothers Dog and Pony show)
was created by Percy Turner in 1958.  Percy Turner was, by trade, a sign
painter in the  area of San Diego, California.   He and his family had always
wanted to have their own circus, so in 1959 they formed their own.  They had a
lion, a tiger, two ocelots, an elephant, and several camels, clowns, acrobats,
a high-wire artist, a dog act and horses, but the Turner family were the only
Black members of the troupe.  The Turners left their successful sign-painting
business in Pacific  Beach to tour the California coast and were widely
successful with audiences. Unfortunately, they had no circus experience and the
show was forced to close after they discovered their advance agent was skimming
the profits.   Percy Turner went back to sign painting and later lettered some
trucks for Circus Vargas when they were in Southern California.  Percy Turner
kept hoping to find someone else who could provide the financial means to allow
him to take out another circus, but his failing health and increased costs
prevented him from ever touring again. The Turner Bros. Circus officially
closed for good on July 4, 1959.  Ralph Rodgers, whose "day job" was as a gas
service man for San Diego Gas & Electric, was an avid circus model builder and
lifelong circus devotee.   He spent his lifetime learning about the circus,
following all the circuses--figuratively and later literally-- and becoming
friends with many of the well-known circus performers and clowns of the day,
many of whom were also model-builders.   Ralph Rodgers' wife, Mary Ann, was
supportive of her husband's hobby and also worked with him and attended
conventions with him.  They had four sons:  Patrick, Kevin, Michael, and John,
all of whom had model circuses named after them.  The circuses were created in
the Rodgers' backyard in El Cajon and reflected Ralph's desire to preserve the
form and spirit of the circus during its heyday of the 1920s and 30s.  Images
of Rodgers' circus can be viewed online at:

.545. 0 |aDr. Joseph (Josef) Paul Reich, M.D. was born 1887 June 16 in Breslau,
which is in modern-day Poland but at the time of his birth was within the
German Empire.  He was raised Jewish, and his parents were Dr. Karl Reich,
M.D., General Practitioner for the Geheimer Sanitaetsrat, and Julie Reich nee
Henschel. He attended the Koenig-Wilhelms-Gymnasiums zu Breslau for secondary
school, eventually studied neurology at the University of Heidelberg, and was
licensed to practice medicine in Germany in 1911. Serving in the German Army
during World War I, Dr. Reich received an Iron Cross First Class in 1914, two
additional awards, and stayed in the armed forces in a medical capacity.  After
returning from the war, Reich married Anneliese Stella Kohnstamm on 1923 August
9 in Frankfurt am Main.   Anneliese was born on 1900 August 3 in Koenigstein im
Taunus and raised Protestant.  She had three brothers: Rudolf, Werner, and
Peter. Her mother was Eva Pauline Kohnstamm nee Gad; her father was the famous
internal medicine doctor Oskar Felix Kohnstamm, M.D., a specialist in neurology
and psychiatry who founded the Sanatorium Dr. Kohnstamm in Koenigstein im
Taunus.  Anneliese's grandfather on her mother's side was Dr. Prof. Gad, who
had taught Dr. Kohnstamm while he was at university.    On 1924 August 4, Dr.
and Mrs. Reich had their first and only child, Hanna Grete Reich.  Because of
his Jewish ancestry, Dr. Reich first left Germany for America as an immigrant
on 1935 December 30, and completed an American medical residency at the Michael
Reese Hospital in Chicago.  He began the process of applying for American
citizenship and becoming certified to practice medicine in Chicago.  In 1937,
Anneliese and Hanna Reich joined him.  By 1939, Dr. Reich was already published
in American medical journals, studying some of the same topics that his
father-in-law Dr. Kohnstamm had, such as psychoanalytic self-observation.  The
Reich family stayed in the United States, and eventually Hanna married a fellow
German Jewish refugee in America, Gerald Oswald Hayman.

.545. 0 |aDr. Joseph (Josef) Paul Reich, M.D. was born 1887 June 16 in Breslau,
which is in modern-day Poland but at the time of his birth was within the
German Empire.  He was raised Jewish, and his parents were Dr. Karl Reich,
M.D., General Practitioner for the Geheimer Sanitaetsrat, and Julie Reich nee
Henschel. He attended the Koenig-Wilhelms-Gymnasiums zu Breslau for secondary
school, eventually studied neurology at the University of Heidelberg, and was
licensed to practice medicine in Germany in 1911. Serving in the German Army
during World War I, Dr. Reich received an Iron Cross First Class in 1914, two
additional awards, and stayed in the armed forces in a medical capacity.  After
returning from the war, Reich married Anneliese Stella Kohnstamm on 1923 August
9 in Frankfurt am Main.   Anneliese was born on 1900 August 3 in Koenigstein im
Taunus and raised Protestant.  She had three brothers: Rudolf, Werner, and
Peter. Her mother was Eva Pauline Kohnstamm nee Gad; her father was the famous
internal medicine doctor Oskar Felix Kohnstamm, M.D., a specialist in neurology
and psychiatry who founded the Sanatorium Dr. Kohnstamm in Koenigstein im
Taunus.  Anneliese's grandfather on her mother's side was Dr. Prof. Gad, who
had taught Dr. Kohnstamm while he was at university.    On 1924 August 4, Dr.
and Mrs. Reich had their first and only child, Hanna Grete Reich.  Because of
his Jewish ancestry, Dr. Reich first left Germany for America as an immigrant
on 1935 December 30, and completed an American medical residency at the Michael
Reese Hospital in Chicago.  He began the process of applying for American
citizenship and becoming certified to practice medicine in Chicago.  In 1937,
Anneliese and Hanna Reich joined him.  By 1939, Dr. Reich was already published
in American medical journals, studying some of the same topics that his
father-in-law Dr. Kohnstamm had, such as psychoanalytic self-observation.  The
Reich family stayed in the United States, and eventually Hanna married a fellow
German Jewish refugee in America, Gerald Oswald Hayman.

.545. 1 |aEdwin Markham dedicated the Poets Garden, located in Ruth Le Prade's
backyard at 1622 S. Spaulding Street, in April 1927 with the planting of a
sycamore tree called the Song Tree in honor of Ruth Le Prade and a wisteria
tree for Peace.  Between 1927 and Le Prade's death in 1969, other trees were
planted in honor of poets and literary figures, including a Gingko tree to
honor the Chinese poet Moon Kwan, an oak tree for Chaucer and trees honoring
William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Rudyard Kipling and Edwin Markham.  There
were also trees in the Poets Garden dedicated to Jesus, the Divine Mother
(Mary) and Brotherhood.  The slogan of the Garden was "Bread, Beauty and
Brotherhood".  Le Prade hosted events at Christmas and Markham's birthday every
year in the garden, and many of the people represented in this collection were
attendees of these events.  However, the Poets Garden was not just a physical
garden.  It also consisted of Ruth Le Prade's circle of acquaintances, friends
and correspondents, most of whom were writers and/or poets.  Le Prade kept much
of her correspondence with "members" of the Poets Garden (there was, however,
no official membership).  In some cases, most notably Gordon Norris and Robert
Whitaker, Le Prade received the papers and correspondence of her friends to add
to her collection.  Beginning in 1953, Le Prade began to donate most of her
collection (both books and paper records) to the University of Southern
California.  She also gave a collection documenting Florence Hamilton's
relationship with Edwin Markham to the Library of Congress in 1953.

.545. 1 |aEdwin Markham dedicated the Poets Garden, located in Ruth Le Prade's
backyard at 1622 S. Spaulding Street, in April 1927 with the planting of a
sycamore tree called the Song Tree in honor of Ruth Le Prade and a wisteria
tree for Peace.  Between 1927 and Le Prade's death in 1969, other trees were
planted in honor of poets and literary figures, including a Gingko tree to
honor the Chinese poet Moon Kwan, an oak tree for Chaucer and trees honoring
William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Rudyard Kipling and Edwin Markham.  There
were also trees in the Poets Garden dedicated to Jesus, the Divine Mother
(Mary) and Brotherhood.  The slogan of the Garden was "Bread, Beauty and
Brotherhood".  Le Prade hosted events at Christmas and Markham's birthday every
year in the garden, and many of the people represented in this collection were
attendees of these events.  However, the Poets Garden was not just a physical
garden.  It also consisted of Ruth Le Prade's circle of acquaintances, friends
and correspondents, most of whom were writers and/or poets.  Le Prade kept much
of her correspondence with "members" of the Poets Garden (there was, however,
no official membership).  In some cases, most notably Gordon Norris and Robert
Whitaker, Le Prade received the papers and correspondence of her friends to add
to her collection.  Beginning in 1953, Le Prade began to donate most of her
collection (both books and paper records) to the University of Southern
California.  She also gave a collection documenting Florence Hamilton's
relationship with Edwin Markham to the Library of Congress in 1953.

.520. 3 |aPrivate Samuel J. Smith was a 31-year-old farmer when he enlisted in
the Confederate army near Moseley, Virginia, on July 18, 1861.  He served in
Mullins⁰́₉ Fifth Cavalry Regiment, then joined the Fourteenth Battalion of
Virginia Cavalry, which, in turn, consolidated with the Fifteenth Battalion to
form the Fifteenth Regiment Virginia Cavalry.   The Fifteenth Virginia Cavalry
merged into the Fifth Virginia Cavalry Regiment Consolidated on November 8,
1864, but disbanded before the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse in 1865. From
August 1863 to July 1864, Smith kept a pocket diary noting daily events and
other accounts including camp life, news of his family, and the weather.
Notable entries include his wounding and the death of his brother near Brandy
Station on September 13, 1863, recovery at Chimborazo Hospital in Richmond, the
presence of African-American soldiers near his home while on leave, reunion
with his regiment in April 1864, and the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864.

.545. 0 |aMarta Feuchtwanger was born Marta Loeffler on December 21, 1891 in
Germany. In 1912 she married German-Jewish writer Lion Feuchtwanger and went
with him into exile during WWII. First they lived in Southern France in
Sanary-sur-mer but had to flee in 1940, escaping to the United States. Marta
and Lion moved to Los Angeles in early 1941 where they eventually bought a
house at 520 Paseo Miramar. During WWII the Feuchtwanger's house became a
well-known gathering place for German-speaking exiles and their American
friends. Both Marta and Lion also helped others persecuted by the Nazis to
escape from Europe. After Lion Feuchtwanger's death in 1958, Marta dedicated
her life to keeping his memory and his work alive. She willed her house and
Lion's invaluable library to USC and became the first curator of the
Feuchtwanger Memorial Library. Marta assisted researchers and gave tours to USC
students on a regular basis and received an honorable doctorate from USC in
1981. Marta survived her husband by almost 30 years. She died in Santa Monica
in 1987.
