His family immigrated to the United States in 1922 and settled in Los Angeles, where Bukowski spent most of his life.  His father was in and out of work during the Depression years and was a reputed tyrant, verbally and physically abusing his son throughout his childhood.  It was perhaps to numb himself from his father''s abuse that Bukowski began drinking at the age of 13, initiating his life-long affair with alcohol.  After graduating from Los Angeles High School in 1939 Bukowski studied for a time at Los Angeles City College, taking courses in journalism and literature.  He left school and home in 1941 after his father, who had finally read some of Bukowski''s stories, threw his son''s possessions into the street.  Bukowski continued to write stories and traveled across America, supporting himself with a string of odd jobs: gas station attendant, elevator operator, truck driver, and overseer in a dog biscuit factory, to name a few. In 1944 his story Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip was published in the magazine Story.  He returned to Los Angeles and met Janet Cooney Baker, with whom he lived for the next ten years.  In 1955, Bukowski was hospitalized with an alcohol-induced bleeding ulcer and came close to death.  After a brief marriage to Barbara Frye, the rich publisher of a small poetry magazine, Bukowski took a job as a post office clerk in 1958, a job he held for the next twelve years.  In 1955, Bukowski also began writing poetry, publishing volumes almost annually.  His first collection, Flower, Fist, and Bestial Wail, appeared in 1959.  It was 30 pages long and the print run was only 200 copies. Bukowski''s first volume of prose, All Assholes in the World and Mine, was published seven years later.  By 1963, the year Bukowski published It Catches My Heart in Its Hands--a collection of poetry about alcoholics, prostitutes, losing gamblers, and other down-and-outs--he had developed a loyal following, and was famous for his use of violent images and graphic language in his work. His column Notes of a Dirty Old Man appeared regularly in Open City and Los Angles Free Press, and its run was later collected in book by the same title (1969).  In 1970, Bukowski quit his job with the Postal Service when John Martin of the Black Sparrow Press offered him a $100 monthly stipend to continue his writing.  Although prolific, Bukowski remained a literary outsider who published his works with small presses, primarily on the West Coast.  His short stories are unsparingly realistic and usually comic.  They often observe the thoughts and actions of Bukowski''s alter ego Henry Chinaski, a hard-drinking unskilled worker, a lover of classical music, and a racetrack gambler.  This character was introduced in Bukowski''s 1965 autobiographical Confessions of a Man Insane Enough to Live with the Beasts.  In 1973, Bukowski gained a wider audience when an award-winning television documentary by director Taylor Hackford was aired, and he also began an incidental career in the film industry.  The 1983 film Tales of Ordinary Madness, directed by Marco Ferreri, was based on stories of the author.  Its script drew material from Erections, Ejaculations, Exhibitions and Tales of Ordinary Madness.  The screenplay for the film Barfly (1987) was written by Bukowski himself and directed by Barbet Schroeder, and the experience of the filming became the subject of the 1989 novel Hollywood.  Crazy Love/Love is a Dog from Hell (1989), directed by Dominique Deruddere, was based on The Copulating Mermaid of Venice and other stories by Bukowski.  In 1985 Bukowski married Linda Lee Beighle, a health food proprietor twenty-five years his junior.  He had one daughter, Marina Louise, who was born in 1965 to Bukowski and Francis Dean Smith.  In his later years, success caught up with the author at last and he evolved from down-and-out to up-and-in: he lived in a house with a swimming pool, drove a black BMW, wrote on a computer, and enjoyed his favorite recordings of Sibelius, Mahler, and Rossini on a new stereo.

Brecht sent another copy to his friend Karl Korsch in February 1945; whether additional copies were created or still exist is unknown. In 1949, after Brecht returned to Germany, he and Berlau assembled the Kriegsfibel for publication; it did not appear, however, until the fall of 1955.

Percy Turner was, by trade, a sign painter in the  area of San Diego, California.   He and his family had always wanted to have their own circus, so in 1959 they formed their own.  They had a lion, a tiger, two ocelots, an elephant, and several camels, clowns, acrobats, a high-wire artist, a dog act and horses, but the Turner family were the only Black members of the troupe.  The Turners left their successful sign-painting business in Pacific  Beach to tour the California coast and were widely successful with audiences. Unfortunately, they had no circus experience and the show was forced to close after they discovered their advance agent was skimming the profits.   Percy Turner went back to sign painting and later lettered some trucks for Circus Vargas when they were in Southern California.  Percy Turner kept hoping to find someone else who could provide the financial means to allow him to take out another circus, but his failing health and increased costs prevented him from ever touring again. The Turner Bros. Circus officially closed for good on July 4, 1959.  Ralph Rodgers, whose "day job" was as a gas service man for San Diego Gas & Electric, was an avid circus model builder and lifelong circus devotee.   He spent his lifetime learning about the circus, following all the circuses--figuratively and later literally-- and becoming friends with many of the well-known circus performers and clowns of the day, many of whom were also model-builders.   Ralph Rodgers'' wife, Mary Ann, was supportive of her husband''s hobby and also worked with him and attended conventions with him.  They had four sons:  Patrick, Kevin, Michael, and John, all of whom had model circuses named after them.

The materials were created and collected by conservation activists Jean and Richard Koch', 'Mineral King is a glacial valley in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains, only 7 1/2 square miles in size and one of the oldest communities in the High Sierra.  At one time, the area had been occupied by two Native American tribes including the Wikchumni Yokut and the Tubatulabel who created summer settlements on the valley floor primarily  for hunting and trading with the Paiutes, who lived east of the Sierra Nevada.  In the 1860s, the first Americans of European descent discovered the valley while building a toll trail from Visalia to Independence and began to mine for precious metals, leading to the discovery of silver in the Mineral King Valley in 1872.  Following the discovery, the first road to Mineral King was created in 1873 by the Mineral King Wagon and Toll Road Company.  Over time, the minerals were found to be unprofitable to extract from their ore, but the valley kept its hopeful name: Mineral King.Mineral King had been part of Sequoia National Forest since 1926, and in the late 1940s the United States Forest Service began to give consideration to Mineral King as a potential site for recreational development. Prodded by a rapidly increasing demand for ski facilities, the Forest Service published a prospectus in 1965, inviting bids from private developers for the construction and operation of a ski resort that would also serve as a summer recreation area.  The proposal of Walt Disney Enterprises, Inc. was chosen from those of six bidders, and Disney received a three-year permit to conduct surveys and explorations in the valley in connection with its preparation of a complete master plan for the resort.  The final Disney plan, approved by the Forest Service in January 1969 (and supported by Governor Ronald Reagan, a friend of Disney), outlined a $35 million complex of motels, restaurants, swimming pools, parking lots, and other structures designed to accommodate 14,000 visitors daily. The complex was to be constructed on 80 acres of the valley floor under a 30-year use permit from the Forest Service.  Other facilities, including ski lifts, ski trails, a cog-assisted railway, and utility installations, were to be constructed on the mountain slopes and in other parts of the valley under a revocable special-use permit.  To provide access to the resort, the state of California proposed to construct a highway 20 miles in length.  A section of that road would have traversed Sequoia National Park, as would have a proposed high-voltage power line needed to provide electricity for the resort.  In June 1969 the Sierra Club filed suit in the Federal District Court of Northern California to attempt to stop the project and the court issued a temporary injunction the following month which blocked implementation of the Forest Service/ Disney development plan for the basin for three full years before the U.S. Supreme Court finally addressed the Sierra Club''s lawsuit.  (Disney had anticipated opening the resort in 1970 or 1971.)  In an April 1972 decision, the Court rejected the suit, which challenged the legality of the entire resort development scheme, on the grounds that the Sierra Club had not established that it was suffering direct harm as a result of the Forest Service''s actions.In June the Sierra Club filed an amended suit; soon public opposition to Mineral King development began to increase in an era of unparalleled environmental awareness and activism.  After years of legal battles between pro-development  and preservationist groups, the Mineral King Valley was annexed into Sequoia National Park in 1978 by an act of Congress.  That legislation effectively stopped the plan to ever develop the area into a ski resort', '-', '-', '-', '-', 'Koch, Jean|Koch, Richard|McCloskey, J.

Percy Turner was, by trade, a sign painter in the  area of San Diego, California.   He and his family had always wanted to have their own circus, so in 1959 they formed their own.  They had a lion, a tiger, two ocelots, an elephant, and several camels, clowns, acrobats, a high-wire artist, a dog act and horses, but the Turner family were the only Black members of the troupe.  The Turners left their successful sign-painting business in Pacific  Beach to tour the California coast and were widely successful with audiences. Unfortunately, they had no circus experience and the show was forced to close after they discovered their advance agent was skimming the profits.   Percy Turner went back to sign painting and later lettered some trucks for Circus Vargas when they were in Southern California.  Percy Turner kept hoping to find someone else who could provide the financial means to allow him to take out another circus, but his failing health and increased costs prevented him from ever touring again. The Turner Bros. Circus officially closed for good on July 4, 1959.  Ralph Rodgers, whose "day job" was as a gas service man for San Diego Gas & Electric, was an avid circus model builder and lifelong circus devotee.   He spent his lifetime learning about the circus, following all the circuses--figuratively and later literally-- and becoming friends with many of the well-known circus performers and clowns of the day, many of whom were also model-builders.   Ralph Rodgers'' wife, Mary Ann, was supportive of her husband''s hobby and also worked with him and attended conventions with him.  They had four sons:  Patrick, Kevin, Michael, and John, all of whom had model circuses named after them.  The circuses were created in the Rodgers'' backyard in El Cajon and reflected Ralph''s desire to preserve the form and spirit of the circus during its heyday of the 1920s and 30s.

Percy Turner was, by trade, a sign painter in the  area of San Diego, California.   He and his family had always wanted to have their own circus, so in 1959 they formed their own.  They had a lion, a tiger, two ocelots, an elephant, and several camels, clowns, acrobats, a high-wire artist, a dog act and horses, but the Turner family were the only Black members of the troupe.  The Turners left their successful sign-painting business in Pacific  Beach to tour the California coast and were widely successful with audiences. Unfortunately, they had no circus experience and the show was forced to close after they discovered their advance agent was skimming the profits.   Percy Turner went back to sign painting and later lettered some trucks for Circus Vargas when they were in Southern California.  Percy Turner kept hoping to find someone else who could provide the financial means to allow him to take out another circus, but his failing health and increased costs prevented him from ever touring again. The Turner Bros. Circus officially closed for good on July 4, 1959.  Ralph Rodgers, whose "day job" was as a gas service man for San Diego Gas & Electric, was an avid circus model builder and lifelong circus devotee.   He spent his lifetime learning about the circus, following all the circuses--figuratively and later literally-- and becoming friends with many of the well-known circus performers and clowns of the day, many of whom were also model-builders.   Ralph Rodgers'' wife, Mary Ann, was supportive of her husband''s hobby and also worked with him and attended conventions with him.  They had four sons:  Patrick, Kevin, Michael, and John, all of whom had model circuses named after them.  The circuses were created in the Rodgers'' backyard in El Cajon and reflected Ralph''s desire to preserve the form and spirit of the circus during its heyday of the 1920s and 30s.
