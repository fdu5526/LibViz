When I was inside, I could see the shadow of Grandmother cast on the paper doors from outside. Grandmother''s presence as a shadow on the door has remained a strong image in my mind. Unlike many other doors, the traditional rice paper door does not totally block the inside and out from eath other. It only creates the concept of this side and the other while simultaneously connecting them to each other. When this accordion book is unfolded, the pages are shaped as closed, connecting the memories of my Grandmother, who is now in the other side, with myself in this world."--Author''s statement-Accordion fold from back pastedown. Shadow book. Paper cutting. Colophon on back pastedown. Paper-covered boards with cutout door designs in matching paper tipped on. Thread and button closure. Laid in archival phase box-Edition of ten and 1 artist''s proof. Special Collections'' is number 7');
