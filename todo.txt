--------------------------------
Questions
	when we enlarge an item, what happens to it in relation to the whirlwind?
		Does it fly out? Does every item in its belt after it fill in its space?
			The item order in the belt must be maintained
			What happens when we put it back? Does everything shift to make space for it again?
				If so, is it confusing to be shifting belts around?
		Else, we can not take it out of the whirlwind, and instead just highlight it as "the enlarged one".
